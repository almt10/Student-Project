# Student-Project
In this repository it is possible to find the different programs created for my Final Student Project.

It is possible to find 3 different folders:

   -PointGrey-OCULUS contains the program needed to display in Oculus Rift the images of the Point Grey cameras connected to the same computer.
   
   -ZED-OCULUS-localhost contains the program needed to display in Oculus Rift the images of the ZED camera connected to the same computer.
   
   ZED-Intermediate-OCULUS contains the programs needed to implement a telepresence streaming-system that sends the images through a network and with an intermediate node that adapt the information to the link characteristics.
